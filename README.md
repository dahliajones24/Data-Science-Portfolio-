# Data-Science-Portfolio-
I'm now working towards a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Dundee, where I'm learning more about predictive modelling, machine learning, and data analysis. My academic route has equipped me with a solid groundwork in programming, data visualisation methodologies, and statistical analysis, thereby equipping me to confront complicated data challenges in the real world.

Through an internship at the UWI Seismic Research Centre, I was able to utilise the data science expertise I gained during my academic career in a professional environment. During my tenure in this position, I analysed social media data for sentiment in order to gain insight into the public's reactions and perceptions regarding seismic events. By utilising data science techniques, I was able to extricate significant insights from unstructured data, thereby aiding the organization's endeavours to comprehend public sentiment and improve strategies for disaster response.

The source of my enthusiasm for data science is its capacity to effect profound changes by revealing invaluable insights and facilitating well-informed decision-making in a multitude of fields. The capability of data to reveal useful information in the form of patterns, trends, and correlations captivates my attention. 
In addition, I am deeply intrigued by the interdisciplinary character of data science, as it enables me to apply my expertise in petroleum geoscience in conjunction with sophisticated analytical methodologies to tackle obstacles across various sectors.
